# 3D Rotation Calculator

This web application allows users to upload their 3D models or choose pre-added geometric shapes and interactively view rotation angles along the X, Y, Z axes besides users can rotate the model using buttons. Please do not upload .gltf objects with seperate texture files for now. I Used three.js and sweetalert2. Also this is my first repo.
